# PasswordGenerator
This is a Password Generator that is capable of randomizing and generating specific characters the user wants to use in their
password. Users can set the percentage of either letters, special letters, and numbers of their choice then they can select from 
8, 16, 32, or 64 password lengths. Will implement GUIs on it once we got all the randomizing and generating working.
